*Walmart Sparkathon 2025 Submission*

DefektGuard is an AI-powered computer vision system designed to detect damaged goods in real time during warehouse operations. Built during Walmart Sparkathon 2025, the solution improves quality control, reduces waste, and boosts warehouse efficiency through smart automation.

## Project Description:

### *Overview:*

*DefektGuard* is a real-time AI-powered product damage detection system built for enhancing warehouse efficiency and product quality. Designed during *Walmart Sparkathon 2025*, it leverages computer vision to identify damaged inventory-like dents, leaks, and tears-during loading and unloading operations, reducing manual effort and minimizing inventory loss.

## Features:

### *1. Real-Time Damage Detection:*

* Detects product defects directly from live video feeds.
* Flags damages instantly with a confidence score.

### *2. Smart Alerting System:*

* Logs damaged items with timestamp and SKU.
* Sends alerts to the dashboard for quick review by staff.

### *3. Intuitive Staff Dashboard:*

* Visual dashboard built with React & Material UI.
* Staff can review, approve, or discard flagged items with ease.

### *4. Backend Automation:*

* All detections are logged and stored using Flask and MongoDB.
* Reduces paperwork and enables damage traceability.

### *5. Integration-Ready:*

* Easily integrates into existing warehouse workflows.
* Future-ready for hardware like auto-removal arms.
